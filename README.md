## Dependencies

- Spring Boot Starter Validation

## Building from source

To build the application from source, run the following command:

```

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine.

```

This will start the application on port 5050. You can access it by visiting http://localhost:5050 in your web browser.

> **_NOTE:_**  I didn't use Dtos just because the main difference between the entity and the dto is the **id** ðŸ™‚, so I added the **@JsonIgnore** annotation to the id to indicate that it should be ignored
